# 👋 Ciao, I’m Giuseppe

I write code, chase questions, and occasionally find answers.  
Somewhere between research and rebellion, I explore AI, IR, and medical data with just enough chaos to keep it interesting.

🧠 Master's in AI & Data Engineering — wandering through Toronto's research labs  
🛰️ Building things that don’t scale (yet), reading papers I’ll one day understand

> “If it makes sense immediately, it’s probably too late.”
